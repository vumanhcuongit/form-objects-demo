I'll have a lighting talk about **Form Objects** at [5th Ruby Meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/462330937273486/) hosted by [Ruby Vietnam](https://www.facebook.com/vietnam.ruby?fref=ts). In addition, I'd like to demonstrate  the technique, so I made this application and hope it can get you guys understand **Form Objects** clearly .

### Case study

Assume that we are building a website where users can register accounts and their stores. It looks like this:

* When the user fills out required information and clicks submit, both User & Store records will be created.
* The user must accept the terms of service.



*Feel free to get your feedback.*
